# Blumo

CS51 Final Project. Optimizing scaled bloom filters for use with sets of strings of arbitrary size. 

I) Create bloom filters of static size. 
II) Wrap bloom filters to make them scaleable. 


Outline of Specification:

--------
Overview:
- Bloom filters, what we plan to mess with in our optimization (hash functions)

I) Create Bloom filters of static size. 
	a) Implement a Bloom filter with static size (m), static false positive percentage (p), static number of hash functions (k), and a static number of inputs (n). 
	b) Investigate 
Wrap bloom filters to make them scaleable. 


Detailed Description
 - i.e. a specific outline of the functions we're writing 

 Signatures/Interfaces
 - i.e. abstractions
 - given a certain function we are writing, what sort of abstraction barrier do we want it to have, what are it's input outputs etc. 
 

 Modules/Actual Code
 - exactly what it sounds like


 Timeline:
 Week of 4/11/15
 - determine implementation language: Google Go
 - plan out functions
