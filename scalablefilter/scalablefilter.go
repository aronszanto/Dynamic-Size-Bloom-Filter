/*

 We started out with this, but were never able to get it to work perfectly.
 Without the partitioning we have since added, we got runtime errors for trying to
 flip bits outside the bounds of the slices we created.

 As we broadened the scope of our academic research we found that scaleable filters
 are seldom implemented without partitioning due to the low flexibility in the number
 of keys that can be inserted into the filter. As such, we chose to prioritise
 implementing the partioned filter over debugging this one.

 This code is purely included to show part of our development process, and no tests
 have been written for it. Also, this shows the code when we were still using non-descriptive variable
 names, and had not yet commented exhaustively.
